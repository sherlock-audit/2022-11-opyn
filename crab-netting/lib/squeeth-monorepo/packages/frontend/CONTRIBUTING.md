# Squeeth Frontend Contribution Guidelines

## Issues

- Check to see if your issue has been previously brought up, and if so add a comment to the existing issue
- Follow the issue templates for bugs or feature requests
- As much as possible, tie the issue back to the problem users are facing

## Branches

- Please create a feature / fix / documentation branch for what youâ€™re working on
- Make a PR from your branch into the either the _master_ branch or a _staging_ branch.
  - Make PRs into _master_ for fixes and single features
  - Make PRs into the _staging_ branch for a bigger feature or set of fixes that need to be tested and then released all at once. Different features might have different staging branches. eg. "staging/strategies" and "staging/lp-nft-collateral"
